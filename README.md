# Generations - A Life Sim (React Native)
 
This is a multi-generational life simulation game built with React Native and Expo.
 
## Running the Project Locally
 
**Prerequisites:**
*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   An iOS or Android device with the Expo Go app installed, or a local simulator/emulator.
 
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser. You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone to run the game.
